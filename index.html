    <h1 class="headings">IS WASTE A THREAT TO US?</h1>
    <p class="text">Waste (or wastes) are unwanted or unusable materials. Waste is any substance discarded after primary
        use, or is
        worthless, defective and of no use. Examples include municipal solid waste (household trash/refuse), hazardous
        waste, wastewater (such as sewage and surface runoff), radioactive waste, and others. Inappropriately managed
        waste can attract rodents and insects, which can harbour gastrointestinal parasites, yellow fever, worms, the
        plague and other conditions for humans, and exposure to hazardous wastes, particularly when they are burned, can
        cause various other diseases including cancers. Toxic waste materials can contaminate surface water,
        groundwater, soil, and air which causes more problems for humans, other species, and ecosystems. A form of waste
        disposal involving combustion creates a significant amount of greenhouse gases. When the burned waste contains
        metals, it can create toxic gases. On the other hand, when the waste contains plastics, the gases produce
        contain CO2. As global warming and CO2 emission increase, soil begins to become a larger carbon sink and will
        become increasingly volatile for our plant life.</p>

        <p class="text">What constitutes waste depends on the eye of the beholder; one person's waste can be a resource
            for another
            person. Though waste is a physical object, its generation is a physical and psychological process. People in
            developing countries suffer from contaminated water and landfills caused by unlawful government policies
            that allow first-world countries and companies to transport their trash to their homes and oftentimes near
            bodies of water. Those same governments do not use any waste trade profits to create ways to manage
            landfills or clean water sources. There are piles of waste used as makeshift bridges over lakes, with metals
            and chemicals just seeping into the water and groundwater that could be linked to homes' water systems. This
            unfortunate situation and dumps/landfills can be seen in countries that are considered the third world, such
            as other West African countries and China.</p>

    <h1 class="headings">MANAGING WASTE—WHY DO WE NEED IT?</h1>
    <p class="text">Waste management or waste disposal includes the processes and actions required to manage waste from
        its inception
        to its final disposal. This includes the collection, transport, treatment and disposal of waste, together
        with monitoring and regulation of the waste management process and waste-related laws, technologies, economic
        mechanisms.

        Waste can be solid, liquid, or gases and each type has different methods of disposal and management. Waste
        management deals with all types of waste, including industrial, biological, household, municipal, organic,
        biomedical, radioactive wastes. In some cases, waste can pose a threat to human health. Health issues are
        associated throughout the entire process of waste management. Health issues can also arise indirectly or
        directly: directly through the handling of solid waste, and indirectly through the consumption of water, soil
        and food. Waste is produced by human activity, for example, the extraction and processing of raw
        materials. Waste management is intended to reduce adverse effects of waste on human health, the environment,
        planetary resources and aesthetics.</p>

    <p class="text">Effective 'Waste Management' involves the practice of '7R' - 'R'efuse, 'R'educe', 'R'euse,
        'R'epair, 'R'epurpose, 'R'ecycle and 'R'ecover. Amongst these '7R's, the first two ('Refuse' and 'Reduce')
        relates to the non-creation of waste - by refusing to buy non-essential products and by reducing
        consumption. The next two ('Reuse' and 'Repair') refers to increasing the usage of the existing product,
        with or without the substitution of certain parts of the product. 'Repurpose' and 'Recycle' involves maximum
        usage of the materials used in the product, and 'Recover' is the least preferred and least efficient waste
        management practice involving the recovery of embedded energy in the waste material.</p>
